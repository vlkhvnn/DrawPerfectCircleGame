“Draw Perfect Circle” 
by Alikhan Tangirbergen
was developed as a test assignment for Nfactorial Incubator 2023

App was developed using Canvas and DragGesture

The App has a boarding page, welcoming the user and giving info about the App

The User has to draw a circle around the particular point at the center of the Canvas

The App gives an Error Alert if: 
1) The User started to draw a circle close to the center point
2) It takes more than 10 seconds for a User to draw a circle
3) The User is drawing a circle in a wrong way

There is an indicator of the “correctness” and “quality” of the circle. It is calculated via the StandardDeviation formula and points array. Also, mathematical concepts such as GraphQuadrants (to indicate at which quadrant is a point) and Midpoints (to draw a line smoother). 

The color of the circle changes as the “quality” of the circle variates. (It is not implemented completely, only using the gradient color of the line). Meaning the overall color of the line changes instead of the specific points. But I tried my best!
